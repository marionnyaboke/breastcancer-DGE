# Analysis of Expression Levels of Apoptotic Genes in Breast Cancer Among Kenyan, African-American, and Caucasian Women

## Background

Breast cancer is the most common type of cancer among women globally and one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths. In Kenya, it is the most widespread cancer with 6,000 new cases diagnosed annually.
